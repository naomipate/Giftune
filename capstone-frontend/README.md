#### Blockers we had during development

- Basic SQL queries everyone needed weren't made beforehand and we had multiple queries doing the same thing. We did some cleanup and fixed that as a group.
- At one point we needed to figure out how to store the user login in local storage or in state on App.js so we could get the user information passed around properly and make a conditional for the sidebar that should only show up after you log in. We asked Instructor Pak for help on this since we were at a loss to get this working. We ended up storing the user in both local storage and in state.
- Logic for mainpulating the upcoming dates and sorting them was confusing and a couple of us put our heads together to work it out and then used chatgpt to clean up the code a bit before we finished making it more efficient.
- CSS was a constant issue we were working on because we'd think we were done and then we'd try the deployed website on a bigger screen and find something else we needed to make more responsive.
- Bugs in CSS and functionality the weekend before needing to give a mock demo, everyone on the team had to jump in on a weekend to fix the app together.
- User profile images needed to be added but we couldn't use Multer without needing a cloud storage, so we came up with a set of images a user could choose from.
- React error regarding keys for items render from a map function on notification.js (This does not effect website functionality).

# React Skeleton

This is a skeleton for a frontend web application using React. It is intended to be used as a starting point for new projects. It is not intended to be a production-ready application.

## Using the Skeleton

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url> <directory-name>
   # Example: git clone https://github.com/9-5-pursuit/react-skeleton my-app-frontend
   ```

1. Change into the directory.

   ```bash
   cd <directory-name>
   # Example: cd my-app-frontend
   ```

1. Setup a new remote repository on Github so that you don't overwrite the skeleton repository.

1. Link your local repository to your new remote repository.

   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin <new-repository-url>
   ```

1. Make a small change, then create a new commit to test the remote repository.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update remote repository"
   git push
   ```

## React Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - JavaScript runtime
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) - Package manager

### Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

> Note: You should have the backend development server running before starting the frontend development server. Each server should be running simultaneously in separate terminal windows. This can be a lot to keep track of at first, so take your time when making changes to the repository.

### Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) - Routing
- [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) - HTTP client

### Additional Notes

Since this is a skeleton, the `.env` file is included in the repository. This is not recommended for production applications. The `.env` file should be added to the `.gitignore` file and the environment variables should be set in the production environment.
